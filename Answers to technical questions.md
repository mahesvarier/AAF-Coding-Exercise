## How long did you spend on the coding test?
- I spent about **1 hour 45 mins** on the coding test.
  - Most of the time was spent on creating the **test cases**.
  - Once the test cases were made, I went on to **structure the services**.

## What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
- If I had more time, I would have added the following:
  - More test cases
  - Would have added Controllers
  - More error handling
  - More logging
  - More documentation
  - More validation
  - More performance optimization
  - More monitoring
  - More configuration

## If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
- It was just enough time.

## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
- One of the best ways to track performance is to use **Azure SQL Database Query Performance Insight**.
  - This tool provides a **dashboard** that shows the performance of the database.
  - It shows the **top queries** that are taking the most time to execute.
  - It also shows the **number of executions**, the **average duration**, and the **CPU time**.
  - This tool is very useful in identifying the queries that are taking the most time.
  - [Query Performance Insight](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/query-performance-insight-use?view=azuresql)

	Apart from that, I have also used:
	- **Indexes**
	- **Query optimization**
	- **Caching - Redis Cache**
	- **Partitioning the database** to improve performance.
